#### [Drupal 8 Theming](README.md)

# Exercise 4: 

## The .info.yml file

To create a new theme for Drupal 8, the only real requirement is to make sure you have implemented the .info.yml file (YaML, like Camel). Drupal 8 runs off of YaML files much the way that Drupal 7 ran off of .info files.

As long as you have your .info.yml file in place with a few keys in place, you have a theme (although if that's all you have in place, it's not going to be a pretty theme).

### Create the theme folder and "YaML" file
1. Locate the **MYDRUPAL/themes** folder in your Drupal installation. In Drupal 8, Contrib and Custom modules and themes, are saved at the root level **MYDRUPAL/modules** and **MYDRUPAL/themes** folders.


2. Create a new folder and call it `acme`

    ```bash
    $ cd MYDRUPAL
    $ mkdir themes/custom 
    $ mkdir themes/custom/acme                 
    ```
3. In that folder create a new file. It should be called **acme.info.yml**

    ```bash
    $ touch themes/custom/acme.info.yml
    ```
4. Add the following lines to that file:

	```
	name: Acme
	description: My first Drupal 8 theme.
	type: theme
	base theme: classy
	core: 8.x
	version: VERSION
	
	regions:
 	  header: Header
 	  primary_menu: 'Primary menu'
 	  secondary_menu: 'Secondary menu'
 	  breadcrumb: Breadcrumb
 	  help: Help
 	  hightlighted: Highlighted
 	  content: Content
 	  sidebar_first: 'Left sidebar'
 	  sidebar_second: 'Right Sidebar'
 	  footer: Footer
 	  page_top: 'Page top'
 	  page_bottom: 'Page Bottom'
	```

5. Clear cache.

6. Go to /admin/appearance and under the Acme theme choose `Install and set as default`.

## Things we might find in a .info.yml file
The following keys are items that we will often find in a `*.info.yml` file. Some are optional; some are required. These keys provide metadata about your theme and define some of the basic functionality.

1. `name` **Required** 
The human-readable name will appear on the Appearance page, where you can activate your theme.

2. `description` **Required** The description is displayed on the Appearance page.

3. `type` **Required** The type key indicates the type of extension, e.g., module, theme or profile. For themes this should always be set to `theme`.
    
4. `base theme` The theme can inherit the resources from another theme by defining it as a base theme. Not declaring this, will default to using "Stable" as the base theme.
    
5. `core` **Required** The core key specifies the version of Drupal core that your theme is compatible with.
    
6. `version` For modules hosted on drupal.org, the version number will be filled in by the packaging script. You should not specify it manually, but leave out the version line entirely.

7. `regions` Regions are declared as children of the regions key. You are required to have a content region. The regions we just declared are also the default regions that are enabled by core if you do not declare any regions in your .info.yml file. 

### Other items
1. `regions_hidden` will allow you to remove default regions from the output if you don't specifically declare any regions.

1. `screenshot: IMAGE_NAME.png` With the screenshot key you define a screenshot that is shown on the Appearance page. If you do not define this key, then Drupal will look for a file named 'screenshot.png' or  'screenshot.svg' in the theme folder to display.
    
2. The `libraries` key can be used to add asset libraries to all pages where the theme is active.
	
	```yml
	libraries:
	  - THEMENAME/global-styling
	  - THEMENAME/LIBRARY-NAME
	```
Theme libraries contain CSS and/or javascript. Theme libraries are declared in another type of YaML file (THEME.libraries.yml). We will cover libraries in later exercises.

3. The `libraries-override` and `libraries-extend` keys can be used to take control over the components of a library, remove items or the complete library, or add additional elements to a library.

4. The `stylesheets-remove` key is used to stop the addition of CSS components for core and contrib modules. However, it is better to do this with `libraries-override`.

	```
	stylesheets-remove:
      - core/assets/vendor/normalize-css/normalize.css
      - '@classy/css/components/tabs.css'
	```
	
5. `ckeditor_stylesheets` will allow you to have custom ckeditor styles attached to your theme

6. `quickedit_stylesheets` will allow you to have custom styles and javascript attached to the quickedit functionality

7. Go to the home page and observe your beautiful new theme.


## Questions you may have...
+ What happens if I don't declare any regions?
+ Why are some regions in `''` and others not?
