# Exercise 5: 

## Drupal asset libraries: adding CSS and javascript to your site

In Drupal 8, "Asset Libraries" are used for loading stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS). The libraries system that you use in your theme is the same framework used by modules and core. Asset libraries can contain one or more CSS assets, one or more JS assets, and one or more JS settings.

Drupal follows this high-level principle: CSS and javascript are only loaded if you tell Drupal it should load them. Drupal has stopped assuming that it should load all assets on all pages, because this is bad for front-end performance.

The biggest difference from Drupal 7 is when it comes to Javascript loaded on pages. By default Drupal doesn't need JavaScript on most pages that anonymous users can see. This means that jQuery is not automatically loaded on all pages anymore. If your theme does need it, you can declare it in one of your theme's libraries, and it will be added to every page.

### The general process for adding CSS and javascript

The basic process breaks down into 3 steps

1. Save the CSS or JS to a file.
2. Define a "library" in a `*.libraries.yml` file, which contains a reference to the CSS and/or JS files.
3. "Attach" the library to a render array in a hook using the `#attached` attribute, by including it in a template, or add the library as a dependency to the theme's `*.info.yml` file.


## Create a library
	
In the following steps, we will create a libraries.yml file, declare our library some css files and create the css files in out theme.

1. Navigate to your theme's root directory 

    ```bash
    $ cd MYDRUPAL
    ```
2. Create a file called **acme.libraries.yml** and open that file in your preferred code editor.

    ```bash
    $ touch themes/custom/acme/acme.libraries.yml
    ```

3. Add the following code to that file:
	
	```yml
    css-stuff:
      version: VERSION
      css:
        theme:
          css/css-stuff.css: {}
          css/css-stuff-print.css: { media: print }
          //fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Abhaya+Libre|Open+Sans: { type: external }

   ```
   
   We just declared our library called `css-stuff`. We can give it any name we want as long as another module or theme hasn't declared it. A best practice for theme libraries is to use some word(s) to describe what the library will do. A name like `global-styles` would be more accurate for this library, but I'm a free spirit, and I like to run with scissors.
   
4. Navigate back to your theme's root directory, and create a folder called **"css"** (if one doesn't already exist).

    ```bash
    $ mkdir themes/custom/acme/css
    ```

5. Create two files in that directory. One called **css-stuff.css** and one called **css-stuff-print.css**


    ```bash
    $ touch themes/custom/acme/css/css-stuff.css
    $ touch themes/custom/acme/css/css-stuff-print.css
    ```

6. Open them both and add any high level css you want. For **css-stuff.css** you could add:

	```css
	body {
      background-color: #e7e7e7;
      font-family: 'Open Sans', serif;
      padding: 30px;
    }

    h2 a {
      background-color: #0c89af;
      color: white;
      font-family: 'Abhaya Libre', serif;
      padding: 3px;
      text-decoration: none;
    }    
	```
	and for **css-stuff-print.css**, you could add: 
	
	```css
	body {
	 font-family: sans-serif;
	 color: #888;
	} 
	```
	Go crazy if you want!
   
7. Navigate back to your theme root directory and open your **acme.info.yml** file

8. We need to make our theme aware of our newly declared library before anything happens.

9. Add the following code to your **acme.info.yml** file

	```
	libraries:
	  - acme/css-stuff
	```
10. Clear your caches and you should now see your css styles in place.

    If everything worked, you should see output like the following in the head section in the source code on all pages of your theme.

```html
@import url("/themes/acme/css/css-stuff.css?of7sd1");
...
<style media="print">
    @import url("/themes/acme/css/css-stuff-print.css?of7sd1");
</style>
```

## Attach Library to a template
In Drupal 8, it is recommended that libraries only be applied when needed. Unless a style is being used on every page, we should use the `attach_library()` function in twig to add js or CSS.

1. Create a folder called **js** in your theme root and add a javascript file called **custom-widget.js**

```bash
$ mkdir themes/custom/acme/js
$ touch themes/custom/acme/js/custom-widget.js

```

2. Create a CSS file in the **css** folder called **custom-widget.css**.

```bash
$ touch themes/custom/acme/css/custom-widget.css

```


3. Add some sample CSS and js to each file: 
    
    **custom-widget.js:**
    
    ```js
    console.log('It Works')
    ```
    
    **custom-widget.css:**
    
    ```css
    article { 
      background: white;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    ```
    
3. Define your new library in **acme.libraries.yml**
    
    ```
    widget:
      version: VERSION
      js:
         js/custom-widget.js: {}
      css:
        theme:
          css/custom-widget.css: {} 
      dependencies:
         - core/drupal
         - core/jquery
    ```      
    
1. Navigate to **MYDRUPAL/core/themes/classy/templates/content/** and look for **node.html.twig**. 

2. Make a copy of **node.html.twig** and paste it in at **MYDRUPAL/themes/custom/acme/templates/node**. Then, because you have added a new file, you'll need to clear cache. 

```bash 
$ mkdir themes/custom/acme/templates
$ mkdir themes/custom/acme/templates/node
$ cp core/themes/classy/templates/content/node.html.twig themes/custom/acme/templates/node/node.html.twig
$ drush cr
```
    
4. Add the following to your theme's new **node.html.twig** near the top
    
    ```twig
    {% if node.bundle == 'article' %}
      {{ attach_library('acme/widget') }}
    {% endif %}
    ```
6. Verify that **custom-widget.js** and **custom-widget.css** have loaded on the article pages but NOT on basic pages.     

## Overriding and removing libraries

### Removing CSS or javascript


If we are using a base theme, it is very possible that some CSS or javascript is coming over from the base theme that we just do not want to use in our theme. Or sometimes there stylesheets coming from core that we just don't want. Even though Drupal tries to follow the rule of only "load stuff only if needed," you may find yourself in a situation where a contrib module or other library is just adding too much. We can remove stylesheets from output at the theme level by using the `stylesheets-remove` key in our *.info.yml* file.

**The following method is for removing individual CSS or javascript files**

3. Take a look at the CSS that is being loaded on your site as a logged in user. Note that **/core/assets/vendor/jquery.ui/themes/base/dialog.css** and 
  **/core/themes/classy/css/components/breadcrumb.css** are being loaded.

1. Navigate to your theme root and open the **acme.info.yml** file.

4. Place the following code in your **acme.info.yml** file.

	```
	stylesheets-remove:
	  - core/misc/active-links.css
	  - '@classy/css/components/breadcrumb.css'
	```
	In this example, we are removing the extra css file that core tries to add with one of its jquery libraries. We are also removing a stylesheet from our parent (base) theme, classy. You probably notice the `@` symbol at the start of the third line. This is a placeholder token. @classy, or @node, or @whatever is the equivalent to `drupal_get_path()` in Drupal 7. Note that `stylesheets-remove` is technically deprecated and will be removed in Drupal 9.


### Overriding CSS or javascript

Sometimes we don't want to remove a file or a library, but we do have a better file for it to use. We can override whole libraries or components of them. Below is an example of libraries-override from drupal.org. You would place this in your *.info.yml file. 

Note: The methods for modifying libraries have changed during the development of Drupal 8. Check [Drupal.org's Theming Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/adding-stylesheets-css-and-javascript-js-to-a-drupal-8-theme#override-extend) for the latest documentation.

**This code is just for show. YAML files cannot have comments.**

```
libraries-override:
  # Replace an entire library.
  core/drupal.collapse: mytheme/collapse
  
  # Replace an asset with another.
  subtheme/library:
    css:
      theme:
        css/layout.css: css/my-layout.css

  # Replace a core module JavaScript asset.
  toolbar/toolbar:
    js:
      js/views/BodyVisualView.js: js/views/BodyVisualView.js

  # Remove an asset.
  drupal/dialog:
    css:
      theme:
        dialog.theme.css: false
  
  # Remove an entire library.
  core/modernizr: false  			
```

**Libraries Extend Example**
  		
```
# Extend drupal.user: add assets from classy's user libraries.
libraries-extend:
  core/drupal.user: 
    - classy/user1
    - classy/user2
```

## Questions you may have...
+ Why is the word `theme` in the library definition?
+ Is `//fonts.googleapis.com/...` a comment?
+ Why do some lines start with `-` in .yml files and others don't?
