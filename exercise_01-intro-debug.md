#### Drupal 8 Theming

# Exercise 1: 

## What is Theming in Drupal and Drupal 8

Theming in Drupal is taking the processed data from Drupal, and outputting it our desired html structure so that web browsers can display our content. Themes make Drupal websites beautiful, and can make the difference between a user friendly site or a difficult to use site. A good theme will show off all the best aspects of your website, while maintaining all the speed and flexibility that Drupal brings to the table.  

By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to understand and use common theme components for Drupal 8 and understand the major changes between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 theming.

## I. Enable Theme debugging and other Local Settings.

### Make files writable.
1. Using your terminal, or through your display, locate your **settings.php** file. The file is usually found at **MYDRUPAL/sites/default/settings.php**. 

2. Change permissions for the `sites/default` folder if needed using the following terminal command, or through your display:

	**MYDRUPAL** should be the path to your drupal sites root directory. Make sure to adjust your terminal commands accordingly.
	
	```bash
	$ cd MYDRUPAL
	$ chmod -Rf 775 sites/default/
	```

### Allow local settings and services, disable caches and enable debugging

1. Download this repo's [settings.local.php](settings.local.php) and place it at MYDRUPAL/sites/default/settings.local.php

2. Download this repo's [local.services.yml](local.services.yml) and place it at MYDRUPAL/sites/default/local.services.yml


## II. User Composer to download [Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel), [Search Kint](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_kint) and [Admin Toolbar](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toobar)modules.
 
 0. Open terminal and navigate to your site root.
 
    ```bash
    $ cd MYDRUPAL
    ```
 
 1. Download devel and its dependencies.
 
    ```bash
    $ composer require drupal/devel 
    ```
    
 2. Download Admin Toolbar and its dependencies.

    ```bash
    $ composer require drupal/admin_toolbar
    ```
 
 2. Download Search Kint and its dependencies.
  
      ```bash
      $ composer require drupal/search_kint 
      ```

 _Composer is the only recommended way of installing modules for Drupal 8. While it is still possible to download modules as packages, users who do so will encounter conflicts and dependency issues. For information on installing a drupal 8 modules with composer, please see [Using Composer to manage Drupal site dependencies](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies#adding-modules)._
  
1. Enable the modules using drush or through the UI.
    
    ```bash
    $ drush en devel kint admin_toolbar admin_toolbar_tools -y
    ```


_As we work on the exercises, you can use the following to see what data you have available to you inside of a function. You replace `$VARIABLE_NAME` with the actual variable that you want to view the contents of._

_In .theme file:_

    
    kint($VARIABLE_NAME);
    ksm($VARIABLE_NAME);
    
    
_In .twig files:_


    {{ kint(VARIABLE_NAME) }}
    {{ dsm(VARIABLE_NAME) }}
    <pre>{{ dump(VARIABLE_NAME) }}</pre>


## III. Clearing the Registry

Through out these exercises you'll be asked to clear cache or registry in order to see changes. 
 
**Ways to clear registry (aka "Clear Cache"):**

* use ``$ drush cr`` 
* go to Configuration > Performance and Clear All Caches. 
* with admin\_toolbar\_tools enabled, hover over the Drupalicon and choose Flush all Caches. 

## Questions
+ What is drush and what is `drush cr`?
+ Why can't I use `drush dl`?
+ My terminal says `bash: $: command not found`. What happened?
