# Exercise 2: 

## Auto Generate Content

You can easily create one or two items of content in Drupal, but what if you need to test out what 50 nodes look like in a view? What if you need to know how the page is going to look with a couple dozen comments all at different levels? Are you going to create each one of those items by hand? Hopefully not. Luckily, we have a handy module that has already been ported to D8 and is (mostly) able to take care of this work for us. Enter the "Devel" and "Devel Generate" module.

1. Enable the **Devel generate** module if you have not already.

### For content

1. Click "Configuration" in the Admin menu.
2. In the `Development` group select `Generate content`.
